# Hand-Written-digit-recognition-using-MNIST-Dataset
Training   accurate   machine   learning   and   deep learning algorithms in the presence of imbalanced and noisy labels is   an   important   and   demanding   task.   Handwritten   digit recognition   has   been   a   problem   in   the   field   of   pattern classification.  Handwriting  recognition  is  one  of  the  compelling research  ideas  because  each  individual  has  their  own  style  of writing.  It depends on  the capability  of  the model  to  determine what  digit  is  written.  In  this  project,  we  look  into  two  machine learning models, two deep learning models. The main objective of this project is to propose a machine learning and deep learning algorithm  that  provides  better  accuracy.  We  make  use  of  the MNIST dataset which is widely used for this recognition process and  it  has  70000  handwritten  digits.  This  project  performs  the analysis of accuracies, precision, and comparison of performance measures   of   algorithms   such   as   Logistic   Regression   Model, Support   Vector   Classification   Model,   Learning   Imbalanced Datasets with Label-Distribution-Aware Margin Loss model, and Symmetric Cross-Entropy for Robust Learning with Noisy Labels Model.
